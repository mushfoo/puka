# Progress Tracking

Master the progress tracking features in Puka Reading Tracker to monitor your reading journey effectively.

## Understanding Progress

### Progress Percentage

**How It Works:**
- Progress is measured as a percentage (0-100%)
- 0% = Just started or planning to read
- 50% = Halfway through the book
- 100% = Book completed

**Visual Indicators:**
- Green progress bars show completion level
- Percentage displayed next to each book
- Progress updates in real-time

### Progress Methods

**Manual Updates:**
- Use the progress slider for precise control
- Set exact percentage based on pages read
- Update whenever you finish a reading session

**Quick Actions:**
- **+10%**: Standard increment for short reading sessions
- **+25%**: Larger jump for longer reading sessions
- **Done ✓**: Instantly mark book as complete

## Setting Progress

### Using the Progress Slider

1. **Find Your Book** in the Currently Reading section
2. **Click and Drag** the progress slider
3. **Release** to set the new progress level
4. **Progress Saves** automatically

**Slider Tips:**

### Quick Action Buttons
