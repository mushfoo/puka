# Puka Reading Tracker Migration Guide

## Overview

Puka now uses a cloud database for data storage with intelligent offline fallback. This migration guide helps you understand the changes and ensures your existing data is preserved.

## What Changed

### Storage Architecture
- **Before**: Data stored only in browser's localStorage
- **After**: Cloud database storage with automatic fallback to localStorage when offline
- **Benefits**: Cross-device sync, data persistence, better performance

### Key Improvements
- ‚úÖ **Data Synchronization**: Your books sync across all devices
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Security**: Encrypted cloud storage with user authentication  
- ‚úÖ **Offline Support**: Full functionality when database is unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Faster search, filtering, and large dataset handling
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: Automatic backup and data recovery

## Migration Process

### Automatic Migration
When you first sign in after the update, Puka will:

1. **Detect Local Data**: Check for existing books, streaks, and settings
2. **Show Migration Options**: Present migration choices clearly
3. **Transfer Data**: Move your data to the cloud database safely
4. **Verify Transfer**: Confirm all data migrated correctly
5. **Clean Up**: Remove local storage after successful migration

### Migration Options

#### Option 1: Migrate to Cloud (Recommended)
```
‚úÖ All your books and reading history move to the cloud
‚úÖ Data syncs across devices automatically  
‚úÖ Enhanced performance and search capabilities
‚úÖ Automatic backup and recovery
```

#### Option 2: Export Before Migration
```
üìÅ Download your data as CSV/JSON backup
üìÅ Keep local copy for your records
üìÅ Then proceed with cloud migration
```

#### Option 3: Continue with Local Storage
```
üì± Keep using browser storage only
üì± No cross-device sync
üì± Manual backup/export required
```

## Step-by-Step Migration

### 1. Backup Your Data (Recommended)
Before migrating, create a backup:

1. Open Puka in your browser
2. Click **Export** button
3. Choose **JSON** format for complete backup
4. Save the file to your computer

### 2. Sign In and Migrate
1. Refresh the Puka app
2. Click **Sign In** when prompted  
3. Create account or use existing credentials
4. If you have local data, you'll see migration options
5. Click **Migrate to Cloud** (recommended)
6. Wait for migration to complete
7. Verify all your books appear correctly

### 3. Verify Migration Success
After migration, check:
- [ ] All books appear with correct titles and authors
- [ ] Progress percentages are accurate
- [ ] Reading streaks are preserved
- [ ] Settings (theme, goals) are maintained
- [ ] Notes and custom data are intact

## Troubleshooting

### Migration Failed
**Problem**: Migration process showed errors
**Solution**: 
1. Try refreshing and migrating again
2. Check your internet connection
3. Contact support with error details

### Missing Books
**Problem**: Some books didn't migrate
**Solution**:
1. Check your export backup
2. Manually re-add missing books
3. Use import feature with your backup file

### Duplicate Books
**Problem**: Books appear twice after migration
**Solution**:
1. Use the search feature to find duplicates
2. Delete duplicate entries manually
3. Keep the version with more complete data

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: App feels slower after migration
**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Check network connection
3. Large datasets may take time to sync initially

## Database Connection Issues

### Offline Mode
When database is unavailable:
- App automatically switches to localStorage mode
- All functionality remains available
- Data syncs when connection restored
- Yellow indicator shows offline status

### Network Problems
If you experience connection issues:
1. Check internet connectivity
2. Try refreshing the page
3. App will fallback to local storage automatically
4. Data syncs when connection restored

## Data Recovery

### Restore from Backup
If you need to restore from a backup:

1. **Export Format**: Use the JSON export from before migration
2. **Import Process**: 
   - Click **Import** button
   - Select your backup file
   - Choose import options:
     - ‚úÖ **Merge with existing**: Keeps current data, adds from backup
     - ‚úÖ **Replace all**: Replaces current data with backup
     - ‚úÖ **Validate data**: Checks for errors before import

### Multiple Device Setup
To set up Puka on additional devices:

1. Install Puka on new device
2. Sign in with same account
3. Your data will sync automatically
4. No migration needed on additional devices
