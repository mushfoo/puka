## Progress Tracking

### How accurate does my progress need to be?

Progress tracking is designed to be flexible and low-stress:
- Exact percentages aren't required
- Estimate based on pages read or time spent
- The goal is consistency, not precision
- Adjust anytime if you need to correct it

### What if I don't know how many pages a book has?

No problem! Page count is optional:
- You can still track progress by percentage
- Estimate based on time spent reading
- Use visual markers (chapters, sections)
- Add page count later if you discover it

Yes! Puka works well for audiobooks:
- Use time-based progress estimates

Simply edit the book and adjust the progress slider to the correct percentage. Progress can be updated anytime, and there's no penalty for corrections.

## Reading Streaks

### What counts as a reading day?

Any reading activity counts:
- Reading physical books
- E-books or audiobooks
- Even 5-10 minutes of reading
- Browsing or planning your next read

The key is consistency, not duration.

### What if I forget to mark a reading day?

Unfortunately, reading streaks are strict about consecutive days. If you forget to mark a day, your streak resets. This encourages daily habit formation:
- Set up reminders if needed
- Make marking reading days part of your routine
- Don't get discouraged - start fresh immediately

### Can I edit or add reading days retroactively?

No, reading days cannot be added retroactively. This maintains the integrity of the streak system and encourages consistent daily habits.

### How do I build a long reading streak?

**Start Small:**
- Begin with 10-15 minutes daily
- Focus on consistency over duration
- Have backup reading options available

**Build Routine:**
- Read at the same time each day
- Keep reading materials accessible
- Make it part of an existing habit

**Stay Motivated:**
- Celebrate milestone achievements
- Track your longest streak
- Remember why you started reading
