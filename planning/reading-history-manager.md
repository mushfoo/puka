# Reading History Manager - Feature Specification

## Overview

A comprehensive reading history management system that allows users to view, edit, and manage their reading activity across any date range. This feature provides complete control over reading streak data through an intuitive calendar-based interface.

## Business Requirements

### Primary Goals
- **Complete streak control**: Users can add/remove reading days for any date
- **Retroactive corrections**: Fix missed days or incorrectly marked days
- **Data transparency**: Clear visibility into what contributes to reading streaks
- **Book-day association**: See which books were read on specific dates

### Success Metrics
- Reduced user frustration with broken streaks
- Increased long-term user engagement
- Improved data accuracy and user trust
- Enhanced reading habit formation through better tracking

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Entry Points
- **Primary**: "üìù Edit history" button next to "I read today" in StreakDisplay
- **Secondary**: Settings panel (future)
- **Contextual**: When streak breaks to 0, suggest "Fix missing days?"

### 2. Modal Interface Flow
```
Opening Modal ‚Üí Calendar View ‚Üí Day Selection ‚Üí Day Actions ‚Üí Confirmation ‚Üí Updated Streak
```

### 3. User Actions by State
- **Empty day**: Click to add as reading day
- **Reading day**: Click to view details and remove
- **Book completion day**: View associated books, toggle manual reading day
- **Today**: Special handling with toggle confirmation

## Technical Architecture

### Data Model

#### Reading Day Entry
```typescript
interface ReadingDayEntry {
  date: string;           // YYYY-MM-DD
  source: 'manual' | 'book' | 'progress';
  bookIds?: number[];     // Associated books
  notes?: string;         // Optional user notes
  createdAt: Date;
  modifiedAt: Date;
}
```

#### Enhanced Streak History
```typescript
interface EnhancedStreakHistory extends StreakHistory {
  readingDayEntries: ReadingDayEntry[];  // Detailed day records
  lastSyncDate: Date;                    // For conflict detection
  version: number;                       // For data migration
}
```

### Component Architecture

#### 1. ReadingHistoryModal
- **Responsibility**: Main modal container and state management
- **Props**: isOpen, onClose, streakHistory, books, onUpdateHistory
- **State**: selectedDate, calendarDate, loading, error

#### 2. ReadingCalendar
- **Responsibility**: Calendar grid display and interaction
- **Props**: currentMonth, readingDays, books, onDateSelect, selectedDate
- **Features**: Month navigation, day status indicators, responsive grid

#### 3. DayDetailPanel
- **Responsibility**: Selected day information and actions
- **Props**: selectedDate, readingData, books, onToggleReading, onUpdateNotes
- **Features**: Book list, toggle controls, notes editor

#### 4. CalendarDayCell
- **Responsibility**: Individual day rendering with status indicators
- **Props**: date, readingStatus, bookCount, isSelected, isToday, onClick
- **Features**: Multiple status indicators, hover states, accessibility

### Data Integration

#### Sources of Reading Data
1. **Streak History**: Manual "I read today" entries
2. **Book Dates**: dateStarted, dateFinished, dateModified
3. **Progress Updates**: Any book progress changes

#### Data Merging Strategy
```typescript
function mergeReadingData(
  streakHistory: StreakHistory,
  books: Book[]
): ReadingDayMap {
  // 1. Extract manual reading days from streak history
  // 2. Extract book completion dates
  // 3. Extract progress update dates  
  // 4. Merge with conflict resolution
  // 5. Return unified day map
}
```

#### Conflict Resolution
- **Manual + Book**: Show both, allow independent control
- **Multiple books**: Aggregate by date
- **Same day different sources**: Preserve all sources
