   - **Implementation Order**: Phase 2B - After cloud sync
   - **Rationale**: Nice UX improvement, low risk

3. **iOS App Development** - 2.8/5 (56/100)
   - **Implementation Order**: Phase 3 - Future consideration
   - **Rationale**: Requires cloud sync first, major undertaking

### Low Priority Features (Score <2.5)
4. **Progress Analytics & Graphs** - 2.4/5 (48/100)
5. **Book Cover Integration** - 1.6/5 (32/100)
6. **Reading Goals & Targets** - 1.6/5 (32/100)
7. **Reading Session Logging** - 1.5/5 (30/100)

### Deferred/Archived Features
- **Reading Session Logging**: Adds complexity without clear personal benefit
- **Book Cover Integration**: Visual noise, doesn't align with minimal design philosophy
- **Reading Goals & Targets**: Streaks provide sufficient motivation

**Rationale**: These features scored low on daily friction reduction and don't align with the solo developer use case focused on simplicity and essential functionality.

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Begin cloud sync solution research and architecture
