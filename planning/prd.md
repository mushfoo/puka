# Product Requirements Document: Puka Reading Tracker

## 1. Executive Summary

**Project Name & Version**: Puka Reading Tracker v1.0
**Date & Status**: June 24, 2025 - Initial PRD
**Vision Statement**: A clean, minimal reading tracker that focuses on essential functionality without bloat, designed to replace existing apps for heavy readers who want simple progress tracking and motivation.
**Success Metrics**:
- Daily active usage replacing current reading app
- Sub-30 second book addition time
- 100% offline functionality for core features
- Zero feature bloat - only essential functionality

## 2. Problem Statement

**Current Pain Points**:
- Existing reading apps (Goodreads, StoryGraph) are bloated with unnecessary social features
- Complex UIs that prioritize social interaction over personal tracking
- Heavy readers need simple, fast book management without distractions
- Limited offline functionality in current solutions
- Difficulty importing existing reading data

**Target User Personas**:
- **Primary**: Heavy readers (multiple books per month) who want personal tracking only
- **Secondary**: Casual readers who prefer minimal, clean interfaces
- **Tertiary**: Data-conscious users who need import/export capabilities

**Market Opportunity**: Gap exists for truly minimal, personal-focused reading trackers that prioritize functionality over social features.

## 6. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Epic: Book Management
**As a heavy reader, I want to quickly add and manage my books so I can track my reading without friction.**

**User Stories**:
1. **Add New Book**
   - As a user, I can add a book with title and author in under 30 seconds
   - Given I'm on the main page, when I click "Add Book", then I see a form with title, author, and notes fields
   - When I submit with valid data, then the book appears in my library immediately

2. **Edit Book Details**
   - As a user, I can edit book information to correct mistakes
   - Given I have a book in my library, when I click edit, then I can modify title, author, and notes
   - When I save changes, then the updates persist and display immediately

### Epic: Progress Tracking
**As a reader, I want to track my reading progress visually so I stay motivated and see my advancement.**

**User Stories**:
1. **Update Progress**
   - As a user, I can update my reading progress with a simple percentage
   - Given I have a book Currently Reading, when I update progress, then the visual progress bar updates immediately
   - When I set progress to 100%, then the book automatically moves to Finished status

2. **View Progress History**
   - As a user, I can see my reading progress over time
   - Given I have progress updates, when I view a book's details, then I see progress change history
   - When I view my overall stats, then I see reading trends and patterns

### Epic: Reading Streaks
**As a motivated reader, I want to maintain reading streaks so I stay consistent with my reading habits.**

**User Stories**:
1. **Track Daily Streaks**
   - As a user, I can see my current reading streak to stay motivated
   - Given I update progress daily, when I view the streak card, then I see my current consecutive days
   - When I skip a day, then my streak resets to 0 the following day

### Edge Cases & Error Scenarios
- **File Data Loss**: What happens if JSON data file is corrupted or deleted?
- **Import Data Conflicts**: How to handle duplicate books during CSV import?
