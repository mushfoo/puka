# Puka Reading Tracker - Claude Code Project Context

## Project Context

### Overview
**Project Name**: Puka Reading Tracker  
**Repository**: https://github.com/mushfoo/puka  
**Vision**: A clean, minimal reading tracker that focuses on essential functionality without bloat, designed to replace existing apps for heavy readers who want simple progress tracking and motivation.  
**Current Phase**: ðŸŽ‰ **PRODUCTION READY** - All MVP functionality implemented and validated (June 30, 2025)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript and hooks for state management
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-first responsive design  
- **Storage**: File System Access API + JSON files for MVP
- **Build**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (90%+ coverage requirement)
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel)

### Target Users & Core Functionality
- **Primary Users**: Heavy readers (multiple books per month) who want personal tracking only
- **Core Features**: 
  - Book management (add/edit with title, author, notes)
  - Progress tracking (0-100% with visual indicators)
  - Reading status (Want to Read, Currently Reading, Finished)
  - Reading streaks with daily tracking
  - CSV import/export for data portability
  - Full offline functionality

### Current Development Status

- **Latest Enhancement**: Prominent Streak Display (UI001) âœ…
- **Status**: ðŸŽ‰ Production-ready with 274/275 tests passing (99.6%)

## Development Workflow

### Critical Git Workflow Rules
- **Feature branches**: Create feature branches from main (e.g., `feature/task-c001-enhanced-bookcard`)
- **Never commit to main directly**: All changes via pull requests
- **Branch naming**: `feature/task-[ID]-[description]` format
- **Commit conventions**: Clear, descriptive messages focusing on "why"
- **PR process**: Include task ID and acceptance criteria validation
- **Screenshots in PRs**: Use `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mushfoo/puka/[branch_name]/[path]` format for proper rendering

### Testing and Quality Standards
- **Test coverage**: Maintain >90% coverage across all features
- **Manual testing**: Test all mobile viewports (375px primary)
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode compliance with no type errors
- **Performance**: <2s page load, <100ms UI interactions, <500KB bundle

### Key Project Principles
- **MVP focus**: Only essential functionality, no feature bloat
- **User-centered testing**: Validate against actual usage patterns
- **Simplicity**: Clean, minimal interface without unnecessary complexity
- **Mobile-first**: All designs start at 375px viewport
- **Offline-first**: Full functionality without internet connection

## Getting Started Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Production Status
1. **Review Completed Work**: `/planning/tasks.md` - All 26 core tasks completed âœ…
2. **Check Recent Enhancements**: Latest commits show production-ready implementation
3. **Verify Functionality**: `npm run dev` - App fully functional at localhost:5173
4. **Review Test Coverage**: 274/275 tests passing (99.6% success rate)

### Step 2: Available Activities
Since the MVP is **production-ready**, choose from:

#### **Option A: Deployment & Distribution**
- Set up hosting (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
- Configure domain and production environment
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments
- Create user documentation and guides

#### **Option B: Enhancement & Optimization**
- Performance optimizations beyond current standards
- Additional export formats (Notion, Airtable, etc.)
- Advanced analytics and reading insights
- Theme customization and personalization

#### **Option C: Quality Assurance & Testing**
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Accessibility audit and improvements  
- Performance testing with large datasets (1000+ books)
- User acceptance testing and feedback collection

### Step 3: Development Process (For New Features)
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/enhancement-[description]`
2. Maintain existing code quality standards (>90% test coverage)
3. Follow mobile-first approach (375px viewport priority)
4. Use existing architecture patterns and components
5. Validate with comprehensive testing before PR

### Step 4: Quality Validation for Enhancements
When implementing new features, use the existing testing framework:

#### 4.1 Automated Testing
- **Unit Tests**: `npm run test` - Maintain >90% coverage
- **E2E Tests**: `npm run test:e2e` - Validate user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Use existing performance test suite

#### 4.2 Manual Testing Checklist
- **Core Functionality**: All existing features remain functional
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Test at 375px viewport (primary target)
- **Performance**: All interactions <100ms response time
- **Cross-Browser**: Chrome/Edge (primary), Safari/Firefox (fallback)

#### 4.3 Quality Gates
Before any PR creation, ensure:
âœ… All existing tests continue to pass
âœ… New features have comprehensive test coverage
âœ… Mobile experience remains optimal
âœ… Performance standards maintained
âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

### Environment Setup
- Node.js 18+ required
- File System Access API support (Chrome/Edge required for full functionality)
- Mobile device/emulator for testing (375px primary viewport)

### Important Considerations
