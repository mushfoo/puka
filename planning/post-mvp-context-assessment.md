# Post-MVP Context Assessment - Puka Reading Tracker

## Assessment Date: 2025-07-04

### Context Category: Solo Developer as Primary User

**Usage Status**: Daily active user (1 week consistent usage)
**External Users**: None currently
**Project Visibility**: Public GitHub, not hosted

## Primary Motivations

1. **Cost Reduction**: Replace Fable subscription
2. **Feature Simplification**: Remove unnecessary bloat
3. **Data Ownership**: Import/export capability
4. **Workflow Optimization**: Quick daily reading tracking

## Current Success Metrics

### Achieved âœ…
- Core reading tracking functionality
- Quick progress updates
- Import/export capability
- Clean, minimal interface
- Daily usage habit established

### Pain Points ðŸ”§
- No sync between devices (desktop vs. phone)
- Could be easier to mark reading days
- No persistent storage beyond browser

## Feature Evaluation Criteria

Based on Solo Developer context with future sharing potential:

1. **Daily Friction Reduction** (45%)
   - How much does this improve my daily workflow?
   - Does it solve current pain points?

2. **Technical Foundation** (25%)
   - Does this enable future features (iOS app)?
   - Does it improve system robustness?

3. **Personal Interest/Learning** (20%)
   - Will I enjoy building this?
   - Does it align with my tech interests?

4. **Broader User Potential** (10%)
   - Would this help others if hosted?
   - Does it improve general usability?

- Swipe gestures for progress
- Quick book switching
- Keyboard shortcuts

### ðŸ¥‰ Priority 3: iOS App Foundation
**Score**: 60/100
- Daily Friction: 20/45 (current PWA works)
- Technical Foundation: 25/25 (major architecture)
- Personal Interest: 10/20 (longer-term goal)
- Broader Potential: 5/10 (platform expansion)

**Development Paths**:
- Enhanced PWA features first
- React Native evaluation
- Native Swift consideration

## Data Gathering Plan

### Week 2 Actions
1. **Friction Journal**: Document daily usage friction points
2. **Multi-Device Testing**: Use on phone + desktop to quantify sync issues
3. **Feature Ideation**: Note enhancement ideas during use

### Technical Research
1. Compare sync solutions for privacy/ease/cost
2. Evaluate iOS development approaches
3. Research hosting options and requirements

## Success Measurement

### Short-term (1 month)
- [ ] Cloud sync implemented and working
- [ ] Zero friction for daily reading tracking
- [ ] Clear path to iOS app decided

### Medium-term (3 months)
- [ ] Hosting decision made and implemented (if desired)
- [ ] Enhanced quick actions based on usage
- [ ] iOS app prototype or enhanced PWA

### Long-term (6 months)
- [ ] iOS app available (TestFlight or App Store)
- [ ] Sustainable personal reading tracker
- [ ] Optional: helping others with similar needs

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start Week 2 friction journal
2. **This Week**: Research and decide on sync solution
3. **Next Week**: Begin cloud sync implementation
4. **Documentation**: Create `planning/cloud-sync-architecture.md`

## Notes

- Keep emoji usage in check for future implementations ðŸ˜‰
- Prioritize personal workflow over hypothetical users
- Build features you'll actually use daily
- Consider privacy implications of sync solutions
