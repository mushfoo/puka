## Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run test         # Run tests with coverage
npm run test:watch   # Run tests in watch mode
npm run type-check   # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint         # ESLint code quality checks
```

### Testing

The project maintains >90% test coverage across all features:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage report
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode for TDD
npm run test:watch
```

### Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with no type errors
- **Testing**: Minimum 90% coverage requirement
- **Performance**: <100ms UI interactions, <2s load time
- **Mobile-First**: All development starts at 375px viewport

## Browser Support

- **Mobile Safari**: Responsive UI with limited file access

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Follow the coding standards in `development-guidelines.md`
4. Ensure all tests pass and coverage remains >90%
5. Submit a pull request with clear description

### Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches from main: `feature/task-[ID]-[description]`
2. Write tests first (TDD approach encouraged)
3. Test on mobile viewport (375px) before desktop
4. Manual testing of complete user workflows required
5. All PRs require passing tests and code review

## Performance Requirements

- **Page Load**: <2 seconds
- **UI Interactions**: <100ms response time
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB
