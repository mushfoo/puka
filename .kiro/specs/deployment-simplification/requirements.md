# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current deployment structure for the Puka Reading Tracker app is convoluted and causing issues in staging and production environments, including broken authentication functionality where users cannot sign up or log in. The app currently uses a complex setup with mixed concerns: Caddy for static file serving, Express.js for API handling, duplicated API logic between development and production, and Railway-specific configurations scattered throughout the codebase. This creates maintenance overhead, deployment inconsistencies, authentication failures, and makes it difficult to debug issues across different environments.

The goal is to simplify the deployment architecture by consolidating the server setup, eliminating duplication, and creating a cleaner separation of concerns that works consistently across development, staging, and production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simplified deployment architecture, so that I can easily maintain and debug the application across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use a single, consistent server architecture across all environments
2. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL use the same API handling logic as production
3. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate a single, optimized container image
4. IF the deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign up and log in successfully in all environments, so that I can access the application features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN attempting to sign up in staging or production THEN the system SHALL successfully create user accounts
2. WHEN attempting to log in in staging or production THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate users
3. WHEN authentication requests are made THEN the system SHALL properly handle CORS, headers, and request routing
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to eliminate code duplication between development and production, so that I can maintain consistency and reduce bugs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling API requests THEN the system SHALL use the same request handlers in both development and production
2. WHEN serving static files THEN the system SHALL use consistent caching and compression strategies
3. WHEN processing authentication THEN the system SHALL use identical auth handling logic across environments
4. IF API logic changes THEN the system SHALL only require updates in a single location

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a simplified deployment setup, so that I can deploy the application efficiently and troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL use Railway's native Node.js runtime instead of Docker containers
2. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL start a single Node.js process that handles both static files and API requests
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL complete initialization within 30 seconds
4. IF the application fails to start THEN the system SHALL log specific error details for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want environment-specific configurations to be clearly separated, so that I can easily manage different deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring for different environments THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all environment-specific settings
2. WHEN deploying to Railway THEN the system SHALL use Railway-specific configurations only where necessary
3. WHEN running locally THEN the system SHALL work without Railway-specific dependencies
4. IF environment configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggested fixes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development experience, so that I can iterate quickly and test changes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the development server THEN the system SHALL support hot reloading for both frontend and API changes
2. WHEN making API changes THEN the system SHALL reflect changes without requiring a full restart
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging in development mode
4. IF development dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear installation instructions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want reliable health checks and monitoring, so that I can ensure the application is running correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL expose health check endpoints that verify all components
2. WHEN health checks run THEN the system SHALL validate database connectivity, API functionality, and static file serving
3. WHEN the application is unhealthy THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and error details
4. IF monitoring systems query health endpoints THEN the system SHALL respond within 5 seconds

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simplified build and deployment scripts, so that I can easily deploy to different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL use a single build command that handles all necessary steps
2. WHEN deploying database migrations THEN the system SHALL handle migration logic consistently across environments
3. WHEN setting up a new environment THEN the system SHALL provide clear documentation and setup scripts
4. IF deployment fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and clear error reporting
