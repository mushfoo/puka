# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Research current best practices and documentation

  - Use context7 MCP server to check latest Better Auth documentation for deployment patterns
  - Review Railway's current Node.js deployment best practices and configuration options
  - Check Express.js latest recommendations for serving static files and API handling
  - Verify current CORS and security middleware best practices
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Create unified Express.js server architecture

  - Replace the current dual-server setup (Caddy + Express) with a single Express.js application
  - Implement static file serving using express.static middleware
  - Consolidate API route handling from both vite.config.ts and server.js
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1, 4.2_

- [x] 3. Implement centralized request handling middleware

  - Create security middleware for input validation and rate limiting
  - Implement CORS handling with environment-aware origins configuration
  - Add body parsing and validation middleware with size limits
  - Create centralized error handling middleware with environment-aware responses
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.3, 3.2_

- [x] 4. Fix Better Auth integration and routing

  - Ensure Better Auth routes (/api/auth/\*) work correctly in the unified server
  - Fix CORS and header handling for authentication requests
  - Implement proper session token extraction and validation
  - Test authentication flows (sign up, sign in, session management) across environments
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Create environment configuration management

  - Centralize environment variable handling in a configuration module
  - Create environment-specific configurations for development, staging, and production
  - Implement proper Railway environment variable integration
  - Add configuration validation and error reporting
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Update Railway deployment configuration

  - Remove Docker-related files (Dockerfile, Caddyfile, nginx.conf)
  - Update railway.json to use native Node.js runtime instead of Docker
  - Configure proper build and start commands for Railway deployment
  - Update environment variables for Railway-specific settings
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.3, 8.1_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive health check system

  - Create detailed health check endpoint that verifies all components
  - Add database connectivity verification
  - Include authentication service status checking
  - Implement static file serving verification
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3_

- [ ] 8. Update development server configuration

  - Remove API handling logic from vite.config.ts
  - Configure Vite to proxy API requests to the unified Express server
  - Ensure hot reloading works for both frontend and backend changes
  - Test development workflow with the new architecture
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [ ] 9. Simplify build and deployment scripts

  - Update package.json scripts for the new architecture
  - Simplify database migration scripts for Railway deployment
  - Create unified build process that handles both frontend and backend
  - Update deployment documentation and setup instructions
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3_

- [ ] 10. Implement comprehensive testing

  - Test authentication flows in all environments (development, staging, production)
  - Verify API endpoints work correctly through the unified server
  - Test static file serving with proper cache headers and compression
  - Validate health check endpoints return correct status information
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 7.4_

- [ ] 11. Deploy and validate the simplified architecture
  - Deploy to Railway using the new native Node.js configuration
  - Verify authentication works correctly in staging and production
  - Test all application functionality in the deployed environment
  - Monitor performance and error rates after deployment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.4, 8.4_
