# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The production Puka Reading Tracker application currently suffers from several critical UI/UX issues that prevent users from successfully accessing and using the application. These issues include authentication failures, poor error handling, loading state problems, and inadequate fallback mechanisms. This feature addresses these issues to provide a reliable, user-friendly experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Robust Authentication System

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to sign up and sign in reliably, so that I can access my reading data consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to sign up THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully with appropriate user feedback
2. WHEN authentication fails due to server issues THEN the system SHALL display specific, actionable error messages
3. WHEN the database service fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about the fallback mode
4. IF rate limiting occurs THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry mechanisms
5. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the user SHALL be immediately redirected to the main application

### Requirement 2: Improved Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand what's happening when something goes wrong, so that I can take appropriate action or know when to try again.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL display specific, user-friendly error messages instead of generic failures
2. WHEN the app falls back to MockStorageService THEN the user SHALL be clearly informed they're in offline mode
3. WHEN rate limiting occurs THEN the user SHALL see a message explaining the temporary limitation and when to retry
4. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL distinguish between network and server errors
5. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific reasons (invalid credentials, server unavailable, etc.)

### Requirement 3: Loading State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear loading indicators that resolve appropriately, so that I know the app is working and when actions are complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is initializing THEN loading indicators SHALL have appropriate timeouts and fallback states
2. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the user SHALL see a clear loading state with the ability to cancel
3. WHEN the app transitions between states THEN loading indicators SHALL be removed promptly
4. IF initialization takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide progress updates or alternative options
5. WHEN the app is ready for use THEN all loading states SHALL be cleared and the interface SHALL be fully interactive

### Requirement 4: Offline Mode and Fallback Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to use the app even when the server is unavailable, so that I can continue tracking my reading progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database service is unavailable THEN the app SHALL seamlessly switch to offline mode
2. WHEN in offline mode THEN the user SHALL be clearly informed of the current state and limitations
3. WHEN using offline mode THEN all core functionality SHALL remain available (add books, track progress, view data)
4. WHEN connectivity is restored THEN the user SHALL have the option to sync their offline data
5. WHEN switching between online and offline modes THEN the user experience SHALL be smooth and non-disruptive

### Requirement 5: Mobile-First Responsive Design

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the authentication and error handling interfaces to work perfectly on my device, so that I can access the app from anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on mobile devices THEN all authentication forms SHALL be properly sized and accessible
2. WHEN errors occur on mobile THEN error messages SHALL be clearly visible and not cut off
3. WHEN using touch interactions THEN all buttons and form elements SHALL have appropriate touch targets
4. WHEN the keyboard appears THEN the interface SHALL adjust appropriately without breaking the layout
5. WHEN in landscape or portrait mode THEN the interface SHALL adapt gracefully to both orientations

### Requirement 6: Performance and Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to load quickly and respond reliably, so that I can efficiently manage my reading tracking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN initial authentication check SHALL complete within 3 seconds
2. WHEN authentication requests are made THEN they SHALL have appropriate timeouts and retry logic
3. WHEN multiple users access the app simultaneously THEN rate limiting SHALL not prevent normal usage
4. WHEN server resources are limited THEN the app SHALL gracefully degrade functionality rather than failing completely
5. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the app SHALL adapt its behavior to maintain usability
